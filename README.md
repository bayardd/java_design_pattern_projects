# Java Design Patterns
This is a repository containing sample Java projects being built to learn Java design patterns.

## Strategy Pattern
The strategy_pattern directory contains a sample project used to implement the strategy pattern. Using the strategy pattern increases code reusage as well as reducing redundant code. The sample project displays this by building interfaces to match specific behaviors, which may then be added to the desired classes.
